    <h6>Our project's goal is to make cybersecurity simple and accessible. MobyPhish uses straightforward, test-based training as you browse, to help you recognize and avoid potential security threats. As part of the project, we are conducting a usability study, so we can evaluate the effectiveness of the MobyPhish extension. By participating in our usability study, you'll get to try MobyPhish and use it during simulated tests. Your experience and feedback will help us understand how effective the tool is and where improvements can be made.</h6>
